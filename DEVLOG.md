### ðŸŸ¢ Day 1 â€“ Project Setup & Structure (June 14, 2025)
- Initialized the React app with Vite
- Created `landing_page` folder inside `src`
- Added subfolders: `home`, `about`, `pricing`, `product`, `support`, `signup`
- Inside each, planned and created component files like `Hero.jsx`, `Stats.jsx`, `Education.jsx`, etc.
- Wrapped components in pages like `Homepg.jsx`, `Aboutpg.jsx`, etc.
- Uploaded the codebase to GitHub ðŸš€
